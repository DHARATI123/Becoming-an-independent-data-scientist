Analyzing pollution levels in Mumbai over the years from 2015 to 2020
Effect of lockdown on pollution level of Mumbai
The dataset contains air quality data and AQI (Air Quality Index) at hourly and daily level of various stations across multiple cities in India, But I am using only Mumbai's data for analysis
An air quality index is used by government agencies to communicate to the public how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is forecast to become. Public health risks increase as the AQI rises. Different countries have their own air quality indices, corresponding to different national air quality standards.
